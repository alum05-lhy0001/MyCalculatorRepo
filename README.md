# Calculator React App

This is a minimal React Calculator app. It uses Parcel as a tiny bundler so you can run it locally with a couple commands.

Requirements
- Node.js (14+ recommended)

Install and run

```powershell
npm install
npm run start
```

Open http://localhost:1234 in your browser (Parcel should open it automatically).

Notes
- The UI lives in `App.jsx` and uses `Calculator.jsx` to display results.
- You can edit `App.jsx` to change the UI or add operations.
